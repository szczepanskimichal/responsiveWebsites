The page presents a culinary recipe in a modern, responsive format. Thanks to the use of CSS, the layout is clear and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices. Key elements such as the header, dish photo, and description are properly highlighted and well positioned.


One of the interesting features is the ingredients section, which appears as a distinct, light-colored box on the right side (on wide screens). This box is styled with the .Ingredients class, giving it a bright background, rounded corners, and a subtle border, making it stand out from the rest of the content and easy for users to notice. On smaller screens, this box moves below the main content, maintaining readability.


Additionally, the list of preparation steps (with the .MethodWrapper class) is enhanced with a decorative symbol after each step, improving the clarity and aesthetics of the instructions. The entire page is visually consistent, and the applied styles ensure a comfortable user experience regardless of screen size.


In summary, the combination of HTML and CSS in this project creates an attractive, responsive recipe page where key information (such as ingredients) is properly highlighted, and the overall design is user-friendly.
